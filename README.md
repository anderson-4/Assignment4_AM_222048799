ðŸ”§ Assignment 4: Full-stack IoT System with ESP32, Flask, and Flet
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build an interactive application that monitors inputs and controls outputs on an ESP32 device. Your application should have:

frontend for user interaction.
backend as the API interface.
An ESP32 that connects .
You must include:

At least 2 input devices of your choice:1 digital (e.g., button, PIR motion sensor)
1 analog (e.g., potentiometer, LDR)
At least 2 output devices:1 digital (e.g., LED, relay)
1 analog (e.g., servo motor, PWM fan)

ðŸ§ª Scenario 2: Lab Safety Monitor
A lab safety assistant that warns when gas or dangerous presence is detected and logs sensor readings.

Inputs:
Potentiometer (analog): Detect air quality
Door magnetic sensor(Servo motor) (digital): Detect door open/closed
Outputs:
Buzzer (digital): Alarm
LED (analog): Indicate air quality level
Frontend:
Live sensor readings (gas %, door status)
Manual test alarm button
